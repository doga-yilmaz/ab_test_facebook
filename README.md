Facebook recently introduced a new bidding system called "average bidding"(test group) alongside the existing "maximum bidding"(control group) system. These bidding systems determine which ads get displayed to users based on how much advertisers are willing to pay.

With "maximum bidding," advertisers specify the maximum amount they are willing to pay for each impression. For example, an advertiser might say, "I'm willing to pay a maximum of $10 for each impression."

With "average bidding," advertisers specify an average amount they are willing to pay for impressions. For instance, they might say, "On average, I'm willing to pay $6 for each impression."

Here's the key point: In this dataset, we've gathered the results of these two bidding strategies over the last 40 days to see which one is more effective at getting their ads displayed to the target audience.
